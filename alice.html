            <p>Alice Lee Robinson was born May 25, 1931 to parents Cora and John Robinson. She was one of 12 children and would soon go on to mother 7 children of her own and grandmother many others. She attended Orange County public schools where she would meet her husband of 67 years, Reginald Brown. Upon meeting Alice, Reginald stated "I'm going to marry you one day," to which she responded with disbelief. But it turns out he he would be correct. After courting for sometime they would end up marrying on April 13, 1952. I recall asking her about her wedding day and what her dress looked like and she said that she actually wore a grey skirt suit. She described the day as being rainy and overcast but after leaving the church ceremony she recalled that the rain had stopped and was replaced with the most beautiful rainbow she had ever seen. Alice came from humble beginnings which, would inevitably shape her into the resilient and resourceful woman she was.</p>

              <p class="mx-0">"Remember that you ARE somebody"</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Her fashion sense was unwavering. Alice could always be caught wearing something Ralph Lauren, with a cute bag, and maybe some UGG boots in the colder months. But, one thing is for certain, you could always find her in some red "Ruby Woo" lipstick. The pride she took in herself inspired others to do the same. I knew her as nana but many would call her mom, grandma, and friend. A few words used to describe her would include: strong, fiesty, funny, courageous, loving, faithful, hopeful, and dependable. She was also a wonderful cook. I'd like to say thank you on behalf of us all, thank you for keeping our bellies fed and our hearts full. She was a silent warrior, she had a strength that surpassed her small stature and she carried it with her wherever she went. She would always reminded us that we mattered, that we "were somebody." She gave us strength and encouragement that would last us a lifetime. </p>
